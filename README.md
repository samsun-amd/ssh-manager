# SSH Manager (sshm)

A lightweight Bash utility to manage and automate SSH connections to multiple servers, BMCs, and clients using a JSON-based inventory.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

bash

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq sshpass fping -y
```

## 📂 Configuration
The script manages connections based on a JSON file. You need to provide your own JOSN file path, The example here is "./ssh_remote.json"
### JSON Schema
The inventory supports two node types: server (for machines with BMC and multiple NICs) and client (for standalone Linux machines).JSON
```
[
  {
    "type": "server",
    "name": "DB_Server_01",
    "bmc": {
      "ip": "x.x.x.x",
      "user": "admin",
      "pass": "password"
    },
    "hosts": [
      { "ip": "x.x.x.x", "user": "root", "pass": "rootpass" },
      { "ip": "x.x.x.x", "user": "admin", "pass": "adminpass" }
    ],
    "note": "Primary Database"
  },
  {
    "type": "client",
    "name": "Dev_Workstation",
    "ip": "x.x.x.x",
    "user": "username",
    "pass": "mypassword",
    "note": "Local dev box"
  },
  {
    "type": "smc",
    "name": "SMC_Node",
    "ip": "x.x.x.x",
    "user": "root",
    "pass": "0penBmc",
    "note": "SMC/HMC accessed via BMC"
  }
]
```
## 📖 Usage
### Basic Commands
```
SSH Manager - Remote Access Tool
--------------------------------
Usage:
  sshm [-p] [-c "command"] <IP>                 : SSH to IP
  sshm [-p] [-c "command"] <Name|Num>           : SSH to ServerBMC|Client
  sshm [-p] [-c "command"] <Name|Num> host<N>   : SSH to ServerHost (NIC)
  sshm [-p] [-c "command"] <Name|Num> smc       : SSH to SMC via BMC
  sshm -s <source> <dest> <Name|Num>            : SCP file transfer
  sshm -s <source> <dest> <Name|Num> host<N>    : SCP to ServerHost

Options:
  -p    Perform a ping check before connecting
  -c    Execute a remote command instead of opening interactive shell
  -s    SCP file transfer mode (requires source and destination)
  -h    Print this help message
  -l    List all nodes
```

### Flags
-h (Help): Print usage instructions.  
-l (List Target): Show all servers, indices, and IPs.  
-p (Ping Check): Verify the target is online before attempting SSH.  
-c (Remote Command): Execute a shell command on the target machine and return output.  
-s (SCP Transfer): Transfer files/directories between local and remote systems.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive SSH
sshm -p 1 host1

# Execute remote command
sshm -c "uptime" server1
sshm -c "df -h" 1
sshm -p -c "free -m" client host1

# Chain remote commands
sshm -c "uptime && free -m && df -h" server2
```

### SCP File Transfer

The `-s` flag enables secure file transfer (SCP) to and from remote systems.

**Syntax:**
- Use `remote:` prefix to specify the remote path
- Works with all target types (number, name, IP, host selection)
- Automatically handles recursive directory transfers

**Examples:**
```bash
# Upload file to remote
sshm -s local_file.txt remote:/tmp/ 1
sshm -s config.json remote:/home/user/backup/ server1

# Download file from remote
sshm -s remote:/var/log/app.log ./ client
sshm -s remote:/etc/config.json ./backup/ 2

# Upload directory (recursive)
sshm -s ./local_dir/ remote:/tmp/ server1
sshm -s ./project/ remote:/home/user/backup/ 1 host1

# Download directory (recursive)
sshm -s remote:/var/logs/ ./backup/ server2
sshm -s remote:/home/data/ ./ 3

# Transfer to/from server hosts
sshm -s data.txt remote:/tmp/ server1 host1
sshm -s remote:/var/log/syslog ./logs/ server1 host2

# Upload to SMC (via BMC)
sshm -s local_file.txt remote:/tmp/ server1 smc
```

**SCP Features:**
- ✅ Bidirectional transfer (upload & download)
- ✅ Automatic recursive transfer for directories
- ✅ Works with all target types (number, name, IP)
- ✅ Server host support (BMC and individual NICs)
- ✅ Progress feedback and status messages
- ✅ Exit code propagation for error handling

### Example

- List all node
```
➜  ssh-manager git:(main) ✗ ./sshm -l
Num  Type    Name     IP(s)
---  ---     ---      ---
1    Server  server1  BMC: x.x.x.x, Hosts: x.x.x.x
2    Server  server2  BMC: x.x.x.x, Hosts: x.x.x.x,x.x.x.x
3    Client  client   x.x.x.x
```

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the sshm.sh.
2. Change the mod of the script:
Bash
```
chmod +x sshm.sh
```
3. Configure you own JSON file.
4. Configure the JSON file path in the script.
5. Verify: Type sshm -l to ensure it is working correctly.
